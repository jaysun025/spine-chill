        <p id="text">
            When I was a kid I caught my dad watching a movie one afternoon. It was a movie I knew I wasn’t allowed to
            see “Tremors” starring Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward just to put names up here. It scared the crap out of child
            me. I was afraid to walk on any ground that wasn’t cement for a few months. Doing full sprints across the
            lawn of my old house and hopping from one rock to the next hoping they didn't sense me. From that point on
            though I’ve had an itch and the only way to scratch it is with horror.
            <br>
            Now that I’ve grown up I’ve decided to dedicate a website to some of my favorites from all over the horror
            genre and medium. Going as far back as silent German films that some find hard to watch but I find
            fascinating. To the 70’s 80’s slasher eras that I can’t get enough of for some reason. All the way to
            today’s modern look at deeper fears then what’s just on the surface, which is now scaring the pants of adult
            me. With everything in between, nothing gives me more of a thrill than finding another good scare to share.
            <br>
            I also love videogames so I”ll also be sharing my love for the horror titles that I’ve played, from my
            younger days with Resident Evil 2 and 3. All the way to the present while I’m trying to pick which game to
            play next there’s so many. You’ll hear about all them here, if it passes through the screen into my eyeballs
            and it’s remotely horror. Be sure you can find it here on Spine Chill.
            <br>
            Welcome.
