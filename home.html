            When I was a kid I caught my dad watching a movie one afternoon. It was a movie I knew I wasn’t allowed to
            see “Tremors” starring Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward just to put names up here. It scared the crap out of child
            me. I was afraid to walk on any ground that wasn’t cement for a few months. Doing full sprints across the
            lawn of my old house and hopping from one rock to the next hoping they didn't sense me. From that point on
            though I’ve had an itch and the only way to scratch it is with horror.
            <br>
            Now that I’ve grown up I’ve decided to dedicate a website to some of my favorites from all over the horror
            genre and medium. Going as far back as silent German films that some find hard to watch but I find
            fascinating. To the 70’s 80’s slasher eras that I can’t get enough of for some reason. All the way to
            today’s modern look at deeper fears then what’s just on the surface, which is now scaring the pants of adult
            me. With everything in between, nothing gives me more of a thrill than finding another good scare to share.
            <br>
            I also love videogames so I”ll also be sharing my love for the horror titles that I’ve played, from my
            younger days with Resident Evil 2 and 3. All the way to the present while I’m trying to pick which game to
            play next there’s so many. You’ll hear about all them here, if it passes through the screen into my eyeballs
            and it’s remotely horror. Be sure you can find it here on Spine Chill.
            <br>
            Welcome.

            This is the movie that truly got me hooked on horror. I had seen other sci-fi horror movies before but
            nothing quite like this. Dark, moody, violante, and also humorous at times. Also the first movie that I felt
            really smart watching because I was figuring it out with them. Understanding the simple yet complex science
            behind some of the things happening while also having a very healthy dose action to heat things up. Being a
            re-imaging of an older movie based on a short story titled “Who Goes There”, and my head is spinning. Long,
            long story short, John Carpenter brought to life a pretty damn good short story and injected it with some
            much needed action and mystery. I can not overstate how much I love this movie and how it really influenced
            what I find to be really good horror. A must see for anyone who enjoys good fun gory moments, high tension,
            really awesome practical effects, and probably one of the best stories for going back watching again and
            face palming because of all the things that happen that make way more sense now.

            To date probably one of my favorite games even outside the series itself. Everything from how the game plays
            to how it’s structured is made for an amazing survival horror experience. For those who don’t know a quick
            story run down; you play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. Out on a mission the S.T.A.R.S Alpha
            team is looking for their lost Bravo team and lands in a bit of trouble. Having to escape from very tough
            monstrous looking dogs, the remaining Alpha team runs into a mansion hoping for safety. They find it much
            worse inside, having to battle horrible monsters while solving the mansion's many complex puzzles all while
            trying to maintain a very strict inventory system. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Heralded
            as one of the if not the best survival horror game ever made so if you’re a fan or looking to find something
            good to sink your teeth into; I couldn’t recommend this one enough.
