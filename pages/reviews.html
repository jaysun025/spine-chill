            One of my favorite movies of all time John Carpenters The Thing is a cult classic and masterclass of sci-fi
            horror. Starring Kurt Russel, Keith David, and Wilford Brimley among the amazing cast. Able to walk a line
            between a kind of "who done it" mystery and some of the most gruesome body horror. Known for its amazing
            practical effects and story The Thing is cemented in time as one of the best.

            Being a fan of found footage I'm happy to say this one does take a very interesting turn right out the gate.
            This Chinese Netflix feature doesn't boast the best critic review scores but I applaud it's brave attempt to
            refresh the found footage genre. I can't say too much because it well spoil the whole movie but it allows
            the viewer to take a more active part in the movie. I really hope people more people give it a chance
            because this might be one of my favorite found footage movies at this moment.

            What's worse that being hunted by an unkillable omnipresent entity that only you can see? Well if it smiled
            of course. Smile is a freaking ride and a half in terms of pace and presentation. It doesn't feel like it
            wastes the viewers time allowing you just enough info to want to know more. While wearing it's message on
            its sleeve seems to elevate the events that take place in the movie. Be ready to face that which you never
            want to inâ€¦ Smile.

            The game that many arguably say put survival horror on the map Resident Evil. A classic by all means the
            original has cemented itself in my mind. Due to some of the best worst voice acting, generally creepy
            environments, and a whole host of monsters. Now almost 20 years old I love how this game has stood the test
            of time and remains one of the best in the genre. Thanks to a fantastic community of modders and game
            creators in their own right, allowing this game to adapt and change through the years and stay relevant. The
            remake of Resident Evil is a masterclass in building off what's already there, adding more challenges and
            fun to be had.

            This. Freaking. Game. Oh man, if you want to know fear boot up Silent Hill 2 turn off the lights and make
            sure you're alone. Younger me did this and had nightmares for several days afterwards, it was worth it.
            Coming out for PS2 this game is a masterclass of everything that makes survival horror great. Wandering
            around a town covered in perpetual fog only able to see a few feet in front of you. Not only is Silent Hill
            based on a real place, (look it up it's crazy), everything from what I just described to the story, sound
            design, graphics, control style, freaking everything is amazing. If you're a true fan of survival horror and
            haven't played this game. Be ashamed, just be very ashamed, than play the god damn game. It's had rereleases
            for modern consoles and they're remaking it with modern technology. Play. This. Game.

            Now I'm not a huge fan of games that don't let you defend yourself in spooky situations. It just doesn't
            make sense to me. If I was stuck in an asylum that was running experiments on mentally ill I'd pick up a bit
            of wood or something. Either way Outlast is a game that doesn't allow you to defend yourself but I still had
            a good time playing. Good spooks and a pretty decent story really help this game shine through. As you make
            your way through the asylum and learn more about what's happening it shows that even the people who are
            trying to kill you have more going on than just being crazy. I'd say if you enjoy sneaking a lot more than
            fighting while piecing together a mystery this is the game for you.
