SpineChill
SpineChill is going to be used to show off some of my voice acting, reading stories and recording them, reviews for movies, games, and books that I loved or hated. 
 
Site Pages
1. Home Page: Talks a bit about me, a photo of me, and somethings I love in horror. 
2. Voices: Recordings of some sounds I've made or things/people I'm mimicing.
3. Reviews: Written or video reviews of horror media that I've consumed. 
4. Evening of the Dead: Recorded book readings I've done some may connect to Voices if good enough
5. Contact: Page that holds all my contact info and where you can find me for what.

Notes:
1. Make sure text is same font type throughout
2. Change font for the review tabs
