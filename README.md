I’m a horror fanatic so this is just a site dedicated to me talking about horror movies and videogames. Might add books later on but for now I’ll stick to these two. I’m sure I’ll be employing different forms of HTML and CSS and JS while I’m just not sure what kind yet. NEED TO UPDATE THIS PART WITH FRAMEWORKS AND LANGUAGES AS I LEARN AND USE THEM.
 
OBJECTIVE OF SITE
 
1. Create a site that holds all of the movies and games that I have watched/played that are horror related. This can be classified as being from the genre or having strong enough ties to the genre or subgenre to warrant mention. I’m not sure if I’m going to include any of the videos I’m going to be making. My scope might also encompass books, comics, graphic novels, and manga. These are still far in the future. 
 
2. HOME PAGE - This will be dedicated to just explaining the point of the site as well as talking about myself and why I love horror. It will also hold what are currently my movie and game obsessions that I just can't seem to stop thinking about or wanting to rewatch or replay. I will have links attached to their more detailed synopsis pages that’ll be made through the favorites page.
 
3. MOVIE PAGE - This page is like it says all about the movies I've seen both past and present. I'll give a little synopsis of what I think about them while having a title picture. I will also make a section where people can comment and like or dislike what I have to say about the movie. Fair is fair. Give users the ability to favorite movies that I’ve talked about so they can add to a list of stuff they want to see.
 
4. GAME PAGE - Much like the movie page this holds all the games I’ve played both past and present. I’ll include a synopsis and a title picture as well as a comment section with a like or dislike button. As well as including a favorites button for them to add to their list. I also need to find a way to get my videos on the site when I start making them. I’ll want to link games to their reviews from this page regardless.
 
5. FAVORITES PAGE - A very special page that will house both my favorite movies and games of all time. I’ll have a little more detailed blurb about them with a link to a page that goes into much greater detail. I will need to take my time with these as they will require a much more detailed synopsis of the respective title. Once again give users the ability to comment, like, dislike, and favorite. Also if a video is made for a game link them.  
 
6. SIGN UP/SIGN IN PAGE - Need to make it so people who are not members cannot see the website past the homepage and the Obsession links on it. Ability to create screen names and attach email addresses so they can receive notification emails. Not sure about this part yet but still need to have members. For now, give members the ability to choose a color for avatar pictures. Need to find a way for them to just load on their own images. Also maybe have preset images that they can choose from if they want.
 
7. USERS’ PAGE - Create a page for the users that they can customize and turn into their own space. Have a list of their favorites there as well as likes and dislikes. Maybe make a messaging system they can use to talk with one another outside of the comments section. 
 
8. VIDEOS PAGE? - Not sure about this one yet but it's still better to be ready then have nothing. Really this page will be dedicated to my videos and while members can’t watch them there they can see when new ones are going to be released. While also getting inside looks at the making of and hints as to what might be in the works for the future.
I might want to hold off on doing this because while this site is a free venture I would like to make money from my videos.
